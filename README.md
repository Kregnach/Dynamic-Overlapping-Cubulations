# Dynamic-Overlapping-Cubulations
The code glues 3 dimensional flat cubes with a well defined restriction, that each boundary vertex must be a half-ball and the boundary of the cubulation is a spherical rectangulation. The model uses a Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation with a simple action. The present code reveals a rich phase diagram with 3 observed phases.
